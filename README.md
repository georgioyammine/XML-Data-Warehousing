# XDW - XML Data Warehouse

XDW is a tool in Java for **XML Data Warehousing**, **Version Control** and **Temporal Querying**, where huge number of files or versions need to be stored. The tool we developed uses [XDP - XML Diff and Patch](https://github.com/georgioyammine/XDP-XML-Diff-and-Patch) to get **diff** files and therefore **save space**. The application stores the **last version of the document along with the backward deltas** in order to query the past.

_This Application was part of a project in the **Lebanese American University**, Course:  Intelligent Data Processing and Applications (COE 543/743)._

App Version: 1.1 - backward compatible with the older version.
